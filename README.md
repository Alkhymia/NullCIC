# NullCIC
A little board to replace the CIC on the original NES or [OpenTendo](https://github.com/Redherring32/OpenTendo), and restore reset functionality.

All the files needed to make your own are located under the releases section.


You can also do the same thing the NullCIC does manually, just check "Reset fix without NullCIC.jpg"
